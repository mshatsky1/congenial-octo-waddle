# Contributing

Thanks for exploring this sandbox repo! To keep things simple:

1. Use Python 3.10+.
2. Create a virtual environment and install deps with `pip install -e .`.
3. Run `pytest` before opening a pull request.
4. Keep changes small and easy to review.
5. Mention any new scripts or commands in the README.

Happy tinkering!
